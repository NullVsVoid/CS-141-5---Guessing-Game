# Guessing Game

A simple console-based guessing game built in Java.

## Description

This program is a game where the user guesses a randomly generated number between a specified minimum and maximum value. If the guess is correct on the first try, the player wins immediately. Otherwise, they're informed if the guess is too high or too low, and their score increases with each incorrect guess. The game ends when the correct number is guessed, and the user is told how many guesses it took.

## Features
